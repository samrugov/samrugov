- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @samrugov
- I'm interested in the intersection of math and biology, and I believe computer science can enhance that interest of mine. 
- I'm currently learning Python and I'm a complete beginner. Working on Project Euler problems at https://github.com/MrConga/EBT-Code-Group-Project.git.
- I'm looking to collaborate on any projects, preferably those doing with math or sciences. 
- Reach me on: Discord (ruga#2939)
